      <h1>About Aristotle</h1>
      <p>Aristotle's <strong>philosophy</strong> stresses biology, instead of mathematics like Plato.<br> He believed
        the world was made up of individuals (substances) occurring in fixed natural kinds (species). Each individual
        has built-in patterns of development, which help it grow toward becoming a fully developed individual of its
        kind.
